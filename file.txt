mkdir test
cd test/
git init
(create repo on github)
echo "dkfasfjdslf" >> file.txt ==>to create file.txt with conntent "dkfasfjdslf"
cat file.txt ===> to print the content of file.txt
git staut 
git add file.txt ==> we also use (git add .) to add all the modified files but if we create new file than we add it 
		     like (git add <file name>)
git commit -am "initial commit"

=============================	
-am ==> add + commit message
-m  ==> commit message
=============================

git push origin master ==> here the file.txt is added or commited and saved to the github
git branch ==> to check the branches
git checkout -b dev ==> creating new branch as well as making head to dev branch
git branch
ls ==> output: file.txt the exact copy of master brach is created to work safely
cat file.txt
nano file.txt ==> it opens file in terminal and also we edit and save there
git checkout master 
cat file.txt ==> nothing changed there
clear 
cd test/
git checkout dev
git status ==> output modified file.txt
git commit -am "file modified"
git push origin dev ==> pushed in dev branch it not effects the master branch
cat file.txt
git checkout master
cat file.txt
git status
git checkout dev
touch file2.txt
echo "asdf;lkkj" >> file2.txt
cat file2.txt
git status
git add file2.txt
git commit -m "Added new file"
git push origin dev
ls ==> we found two files
git checkout master
ls ==> only one file
git checkout dev
git log ==> three commit will be shown 1 and 2 of file.txt 3. of file2.txt

=========
MERGING
=========
To merge first we have to be in the branch in which we have to merge (suppose in this case master)

git checkout merge
 
then merge the branch which we want (In this case dev)

git merge --squash dev ==> --squash is use to create one single commit of whole branch since brach 
			   have its own commits.
ls
git status
git commit -m "Merged dev branch"
git status
git push origin master

//IF WE Want To Push On Other branches except master than we have to do simply

first checkout on branch in which you want to merge than

git merge <branch name> (name of branch you want to merge)
